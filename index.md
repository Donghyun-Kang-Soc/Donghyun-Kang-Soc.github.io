I am a PhD candidate in the Sociology Department at the University of Chicago. My research aims to advance our understanding of the emergence, diffusion, and evolution of ideas and practices in science, technology, and civic domains. I am particularly eager to bridge computational large-scale analysis with theoretical insights from the sociology of knowledge, science, and organization.
