<p>Hello! I am Donghyun Kang, an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://sociology.yonsei.ac.kr/">Department of Sociology at Yonsei University</a>, Seoul, Korea. I completed my Ph.D. in <a href="https://sociology.uchicago.edu/">Sociology at the University of Chicago</a>, advised by <a href="https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/James-A-Evans">James Evans</a>, and also worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the <a href="https://knowledgelab.org/">Knowledge Lab</a>. Before my time in Chicago, I earned a B.A. in Business Administration and an M.A. in Sociology from Seoul National University.</p>

<p>My research seeks to advance our understanding of the emergence, diffusion, and evolution of ideas and practices in science and technology, as well as civic domains. I am particularly eager to connect large-scale computational analysis with theoretical insights from the sociology of knowledge, science, and organizations.</p>
