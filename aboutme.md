<p>Hello! I am Donghyun Kang, an incoming Postdoctoral Scholar in the <a href="https://www.knowledgelab.org/">Knowledge Lab</a> at the University of Chicago from September 2024. I will be completing my Ph.D. in <a href="https://sociology.uchicago.edu/">Sociology</a>, under the guidance of James Evans. Before Chicago, I earned a B.A. in Business Administration and an M.A. in Sociology from Seoul National University.

<p>My research aims to advance our understanding of the emergence, diffusion, and evolution of ideas and practices in science and technology and across civic domains. I am particularly eager to bridge computational large-scale analysis with theoretical insights from the sociology of knowledge, science, and organization.</p>

<p>For more information, please see my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6vo4bprh1cv4b25ebgqxd/Donghyun_Kang_CV_Updated.pdf?rlkey=y1jy8aud3ujat2bfiia49y1g1&st=6y29r4tj&raw=1">CV</a>.
