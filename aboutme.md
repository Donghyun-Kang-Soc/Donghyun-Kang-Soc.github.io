<p>Hello! I am Donghyun Kang, a PhD candidate in the Sociology Department at the University of Chicago. I am a member of <a href="https://www.knowledgelab.org/">Knowledge Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/James-A-Evans">James Evans</a>. Before Chicago, I completed a B.A. in Business Administration and M.A. in Sociology at Seoul National University.</p>

<p>My research aims to advance our understanding of the emergence, diffusion, and evolution of ideas and practices in science and technology and across civic domains. I am particularly eager to bridge computational large-scale analysis with theoretical insights from the sociology of knowledge, science, and organization.</p>
